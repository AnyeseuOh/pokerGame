Included is an example scene with all the dice with every texture and a example script of how write a simple detection of which side is up.
I would highly recommend re-writing it to suite your needs as in some cases the numbers reported might return a incorrect number.

This package is for the Art assets only; the scripts, shaders included are just a common curtosy and I will not be supporting them, you
are free to manipulate and modify the scripts as need be. If you have any problems with the model or texture sizes, please feel free to 
contact me and I can help you out.
